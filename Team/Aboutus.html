        <p> In 2009 we founded this company of peanut butter making. It was to help those to have a good time no matter
            what.
            This peanut butter is for eating but you can have food fights with becuase it becomes much less sticky in
            water.
            we have more peanut butter than anyone else. We actaully have a bissness halliday were we have a peanut
            butter
            eating contest yum yum. we also have a charity were every 5 gallons sold 2 gallons are givein to the
            homeless
            and poor. the peanut butter is rumered to be the best in the world. Our peanuts are better than the ones
            that
            are in different places.</p>
