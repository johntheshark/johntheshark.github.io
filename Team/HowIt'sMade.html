    <img id="peanut" src="peanut.jpg" alt="Logo">

    <h2>Video at the bottom; We start by hand peeling our super awesome mega peanuts, then we decide which ones are cool
        enough. Once we have done all this, we go through 3 different roasting processes, and if the peanuts survive and
        aren't dust by now the go on to the next step. This involves repurposed lawn mowers. The blades grind through
        the peanuts and leaves super peanut butter for us to collect, and that is bottled up and this is the finished
        product you know and love![warning, super peanut butter has up to 12% uranium. It is also known to cause sudden
        idocy, oh crap! its afecting mee. Other known symptoms include vomiting, sneezing, coughing, weeing, depression,
        heart desease, cancer and much more. Our super peanut butter is currently being used in the U.S. military, being
        much more effective than napalm.] we hope you enjoy our product!</h2>
